# Document Question Answering Chrome Extension

This Chrome (built for Chromium based browsers) extension allows researchers to upload relevant documents and use a local LLM (Large Language Model) AI model to automatically answer questions and autofill forms on websites. By leveraging the power of natural language processing and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, this extension aims to streamline the process of completing repetitive paperwork, saving researchers valuable time and enabling them to focus more on their core research activities.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Researchers can upload various document formats (PDF, Word, plain text) containing relevant information for their research projects.
- **Question Answering**: The extension listens for user interactions on input fields and textareas, and automatically sends the associated placeholder or title text as a question to the local LLM AI model.
- **Intelligent Form Autofill**: Based on the uploaded documents and the RAG technique, the AI model generates relevant answers and populates the input fields or textareas with the appropriate information.
- **Customizable Model**: The extension allows researchers to use their own locally hosted LLM AI model, enabling them to leverage domain-specific knowledge and fine-tune the model for their specific research areas.

## Benefits for Researchers

1. **Time-saving**: By automating the process of answering common questions and filling out forms, researchers can save significant time that would otherwise be spent on repetitive paperwork tasks.

2. **Increased Productivity**: With reduced administrative overhead, researchers can dedicate more time and effort to their core research activities, potentially leading to faster progress and more impactful discoveries.

3. **Grant Application Efficiency**: When applying for grants or funding opportunities, researchers often need to provide similar information across multiple forms and applications. This extension can streamline the process by intelligently populating relevant fields based on the provided documents.

4. **Customizable Knowledge Base**: By using a locally hosted LLM AI model, researchers can ensure that the extension's knowledge base is tailored to their specific research domain, potentially improving the accuracy and relevance of the generated answers.
